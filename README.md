### Practical Data Science: Analyzing and Measuring Rising Sea Levels

This project utilizes the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to predict the rise in sea levels over the next two years, based on hourly data collected by the University of Hawaii in partnership with NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). Using Python and the Pandas library, the model analyzes historical sea level data to forecast future trends. The goal is to accurately predict sea level changes over a two-year horizon, providing valuable insights for climate impact assessments and coastal planning.
